# ML_ClassificationFlow_KNN_NaiveBayes_DecisionTree
ML Classification Workflow on Titanic Dataset - A structured implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree algorithms. This project includes robust data preprocessing, feature engineering, and cross-validation techniques, providing an end-to-end approach to model development and evaluation metrics.

This repository includes implementations in Python, leveraging popular ML libraries for an end-to-end model development pipeline.

**Project Overview**
The goal is to accurately predict passenger survival on the Titanic, using three core algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees.
The workflow includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and more.
- Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to enhance predictive performance.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Utilizing cross-validation techniques, grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and analyzing model performance.

**Key Libraries and Tools**
This project was built in Python using:
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Scikit-Learn for implementing ML algorithms, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
